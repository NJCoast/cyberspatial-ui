            at any time by the Department of Community Affairs appointed account administrator at his or her discretion or

            approved solely by the Department of Community Affairs appointed account administrator, who maintains sole right

    </h5>
    <p>
        <span>1. The Services and Content posted by collaboratory members may include hyperlinks to other web sites or content

    <h5>
        <span>Section S. Changes to the Terms</span>
    </h5>
    <p>
        <span>1. NJcoast may make changes to the Universal Terms from time to time. When these changes are made, NJcoast will archive
            past versions of Universal Terms on the site &lt;hyperlink&gt;.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>2. You understand and agree that if you use the Services after the date on which the Universal Terms have changed,
            NJcoast will treat your use as acceptance of the updated Universal Terms.</span>
    </p>
    <h5>
        <span>Section T. General Legal Terms</span>
    </h5>
    <p>
        <span>1. The Terms constitute the whole legal agreement between you and NJcoast and govern your use of the Services (but
            excluding any services which NJcoast may provide to you under a separate written agreement), and completely replace
            any prior agreements between you and NJcoast in relation to the Services.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>2. You agree that NJcoast may provide you with notices, including those regarding changes to the Terms, by email
            or postings on the njcoast.us.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>3. You agree that if NJcoast does not exercise or enforce any legal right or remedy which is contained in the Terms
            (or which NJcoast has the benefit of under any applicable law), this will not be taken to be a formal waiver
            of NJcoast&#39;s rights and that those rights or remedies will still be available to NJcoast.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>4. If any court of law, having the jurisdiction to decide on this matter, rules that any provision of these Terms
            is invalid, then that provision will be removed from the Terms without affecting the rest of the Terms. The remaining
            provisions of the Terms will continue to be valid and enforceable.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>5. You acknowledge and agree that each member of NJcoast shall be third party beneficiaries to the Terms and that
            these persons shall be entitled to directly enforce, and rely upon, any provision of the Terms which confers
            a benefit on (or rights in favor of) them. Other than this, no other person or company shall be third party beneficiaries
            to the Terms.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>6. The Terms, and your relationship with NJcoast under the Terms, shall be governed by the laws of the</span>
        <span>State of New Jersey without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. You and NJcoast agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
            of the courts located within the county of St. Joseph, Indiana to resolve any legal matter arising from the Terms.
            Notwithstanding this, you agree that NJcoast shall still be allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent
            type of urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</span>
